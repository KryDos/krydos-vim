=========
This is  my personal VIM configuration. 

 - **.vimrc** - is config with my personal preferences like (nu, expandtab, tabsize etc...)
 - **.vim** - is main folder that contains colorschemes and other stuff like syntax and snippets. Also this folder contain **Vundle** and vimrc with settings for plugins.


 For installation in **Windows** you have to rename your .vimrc to **_vimrc** and your .vim folder to **vimfiles**

Don't forget install the **Vundle** and after this call the BundleInstall command.

List of plugins:
 - **nerdtree**
 - **buffergator**
 - **airline**
 - **supertab**
 - **fugitive**
 - **rust.vim**
 - **snipmate**
 - **taglist**
 - **L9**
 - **FuzzyFinder**

Shortcuts and commands:
 - F4 - call the buffergator at the left of the window
 - F5 - call the nerdtree at the left of the window
 - F6 - call the taglist at the right of the window
 - :Find - command calling FuzzyFinder plugin.
