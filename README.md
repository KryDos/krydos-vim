=========
This is  my personal VIM configuration. 

 - **.vimrc** - is config with my personal preferences like (nu, expandtab, tabsize etc...)
 - **.vim** - is main folder that contains colorschemes and other stuff like syntax and snippets. Also this folder contain **Vundle** and vimrc with settings for plugins.


For installation in **Windows** you have to rename your .vimrc to **_vimrc** and your .vim folder to **vimfiles**

Don't forget install the **Vundle** and after this call the BundleInstall command.
